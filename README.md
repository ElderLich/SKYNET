# MDPro4 duel AI workspace

Three separate projects live here. Normal WindBot development and the experimental
SKYNET training project have their own source trees, solutions and executables.

| Folder | Purpose | Start here |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `WindBot/` | Normal WindBot, with its original deck executors, names, launcher and `WindBot.exe` | [WindBot build and run instructions](WindBot/README.md) |
| `SKYNET/` | Experimental general duel AI, reviewed expert modes, episode collection and offline learning; produces `SKYNET.exe` | [SKYNET capabilities and training](SKYNET/README.md) |
| `Arena/` | Browser console for comparing bots and recording results; includes dedicated-server setup tools | [Arena setup and running instructions](Arena/README.md) |

All three folders share this Git repository. Work on normal executors in
`WindBot/`; train and evaluate the general AI in `SKYNET/`; compare frozen
versions in `Arena/`. Each bot keeps its own executable, resources and duel state.

For new normal executors, start with the
[RDA-based template](WindBot/Templates/RdaPlannerExecutor.cs.template) and
[authoring guide](WindBot/Guides/ExecutorAuthoring.md). Existing executors can be
improved in place. The template supplies planning structure; card effects and
selection callbacks still need script-backed implementation and testing.

For a ready-to-copy request, use the
[new executor or improvement prompt](WindBot/Guides/ExecutorAuthoring.md#copyable-starter-prompt).

## Build the bots

Run from this directory in a Visual Studio Developer PowerShell with the .NET
Framework 4.8 targeting pack installed:

```powershell
msbuild WindBot/WindBot.sln /p:Configuration=Release /p:Platform="Any CPU"
msbuild SKYNET/Skynet.sln /p:Configuration=Release /p:Platform="Any CPU"
```

The outputs are `WindBot/bin/Release/WindBot.exe`,
`WindBot/BotWrapper/bin/Release/Bot.exe`, and `SKYNET/bin/Release/SKYNET.exe`.
Each bot has its own `Decks` and `Dialogs` resources. Supply an explicit compatible
`cards.cdb` with `DbPath=...`. Standard and Rush database/script snapshots are
bundled under `DeckWorkshop/Data/`; the duel server is configured separately.
The selected database must match that server's scripts and rules.

For automatic MSBuild discovery, Linux/Mono prerequisites and offline checks,
see [WindBot's portable workflow](WindBot/README.md#build-and-check-on-windows-or-linux).

## Deck Workshop

Open Arena's **Deck Workshop** (`http://127.0.0.1:3000/#workshop`) to import a
`.ydk`, explore card/effect/Lua graphs and categorized RelatedCards links, export
a combined card-text/script report, and generate an RDA-first executor starter.
The included Standard and Rush snapshots work without the original game folders;
Edison is excluded. Rush supports research and reports, while Standard supports
starter generation. See [setup, data provenance and limits](DeckWorkshop/README.md).

Generated starters are `Test` executors with disabled models. Implement the card
semantics and prompts, build, run offline checks, then validate against an explicit
compatible duel host before comparing frozen versions in Arena.

## Run Arena

With Node.js installed (Node.js 24 is the validated runtime):

```powershell
cd Arena
npm ci --no-audit --no-fund
.\Start-SkynetArena.ps1
```

Open <http://127.0.0.1:3000>. Later, `Arena/Skynet Arena.cmd` starts the same console.
The launcher builds the frontend if needed. Actual matches also require a dedicated
compatible `arena-srvpro` server and configured bot/database paths in **Settings**;
starting the dashboard alone does not start a duel server. See the
[complete Arena instructions](Arena/README.md) for normal WindBot, native SKYNET
and local server setup. Arena comparisons keep SKYNET training disabled; opt-in
episode collection and offline training are documented in `SKYNET/README.md`.

## Dialogs and bot roster

Both bot projects include the dialog JSON files supplied from
`D:\Programs\GitHub\MDPro4_Data\Data\Windbot\Dialogs`.
`default.json` is a byte-for-byte alias of `Universal.EN.json`, because the supplied
folder has no default file and both original clients use that name by default.
The normal launcher uses the supplied English bot roster from
`D:\Programs\GitHub\MDPro4_Data\Data\locales\en-US\bot.conf`, stored here as
`WindBot/BotWrapper/bot.conf`, extended with the new executor entries. These are versioned copies, so a fresh checkout does
not need those external paths. They are not live links to the data repository.
Source paths and hashes are recorded in
[`WindBot/resource-provenance.json`](WindBot/resource-provenance.json).

`bot.conf` is the normal WindBot roster, not SKYNET's configuration file. Arena can
use it for normal WindBot and use explicit deck profiles for SKYNET. Original bot
and dialog names are preserved.

## Validation

```powershell
python SKYNET/Tools/Skynet/test_learning.py
python SKYNET/Tools/Skynet/test_ygo_agent_inspection.py
python SKYNET/Tools/Skynet/test_ygo_agent_shadow.py
python SKYNET/Tools/Skynet/test_demonstrations.py
python Arena/Tools/test_arena_process_owner.py
cd Arena
npm test
npm run build
```

Normal-bot checks, fixed-hand combo fixtures and the latest measured executor
results are documented in [WindBot's README](WindBot/README.md). Preserve a
baseline executable before changing behavior, then compare it with a frozen
candidate using the same decks, database, scripts and opponents. Use a Debug
WindBot build with `Debug=True` when diagnosing decisions from duel traces.

Arena stores settings and results in `Arena/data/` by default. Select the exact
runtime paths in Settings; rebuilding a different directory does not update a
saved path. Local logs and test receipts belong under ignored `Artifacts/`.

WindBot/YGOSharp attribution and licenses are retained. SKYNET's current coverage,
learning limits and research provenance remain documented in its own README.
