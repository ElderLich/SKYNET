# Skynet Arena

An English experiment dashboard for **MDPro4 AI Systems**. Compare normal WindBot
executors and SKYNET policies, watch experiment progress, inspect process output,
and export results. Configuration and history persist in SQLite. This folder is
independent of the sibling `WindBot/` and `SKYNET/` source projects.

Derived from [WindBot Arena](https://github.com/mercury233/windbot-arena), pinned
at `371e62de0b0b29a8f097f84293e9f8f0f15a7509`. Original file hashes and provenance
are in [UPSTREAM.json](UPSTREAM.json); Git tracks our changes after import.
Upstream package metadata declares MIT; its snapshot has no separate LICENSE
file. Upstream attribution remains applicable.

## Start

Use Node.js 24 (validated), then:

```powershell
cd Arena
npm ci
.\Start-SkynetArena.ps1
```

Open **http://127.0.0.1:3000**. The launcher builds the interface if necessary.
After installing dependencies, `Skynet Arena.cmd` provides a double-click entry
point. Keep its console open; Ctrl+C shuts down Arena and its owned processes.
Use `-Build` after frontend changes, or `-Port 3137` for another port.

```powershell
.\Start-SkynetArena.ps1 -Build -Port 3137
```

You can also run `npm run build` and `npm start` directly on Windows or Linux.
Model files and server credentials are not shipped. Standard and Rush database
and script snapshots are included in `../DeckWorkshop/Data/`.

## Deck Workshop

Choose **Deck Workshop** in the top navigation, or open
**http://127.0.0.1:3000/#workshop**. Import/paste a `.ydk` to browse card text,
effect callbacks, numbered Lua source, literal script links and categorized
RelatedCards relationships. Export the combined text/Lua report or generate a
Standard RDA starter with its deck and provenance manifest. Analysis requires no
duel server. The Workshop never changes bot source, settings or training state.

The two CDBs and extracted scripts are versioned for fresh checkouts, with Edison
excluded. Rush analysis/report export is supported; Rush executor generation is
disabled. The generated Standard model starts disabled and its registration is
`Test`. See [Deck Workshop instructions](../DeckWorkshop/README.md) for source
provenance, refresh commands, generation and analysis limits.

On Linux, install the Mono/compiler/SQLite prerequisites in
[WindBot's README](../WindBot/README.md#build-and-check-on-windows-or-linux), then
use `npm ci`, `npm run build`, and `npm start` here. Local normal-WindBot mode
launches `mono WindBot.exe` on non-Windows hosts; Windows launches the executable
directly. Remote WindBot remains supported. This change does not add Mono launch
support to the separate native SKYNET mode. Linux command construction is tested;
Linux execution was unavailable locally because WSL could not start.

## Normal WindBot setup

Build the restored normal project from the workspace root:

```powershell
msbuild WindBot/WindBot.sln /t:Build /p:Configuration=Release /p:Platform="Any CPU"
Copy-Item -LiteralPath 'DeckWorkshop/Data/standard/cards.cdb' `
  -Destination WindBot/bin/Release/cards.cdb
```

The database copy is an ignored local runtime input; use the database matching
that server's scripts. The normal build includes decks, SQLite dependencies and
dialogs. `WindBot/Dialogs/` is the snapshot from
`D:/Programs/GitHub/MDPro4_Data/Data/Windbot/Dialogs`, with `default.json` as a
copy of `Universal.EN.json`. `WindBot/BotWrapper/bot.conf` is the English catalog
from `D:/Programs/GitHub/MDPro4_Data/Data/locales/en-US/bot.conf`.

A new Arena database starts with **Local WindBot** for both participants, the
absolute sibling `WindBot/bin/Release` runtime, the English
`WindBot/BotWrapper/bot.conf` catalog, and distinct HTTP ports 2399 and 2398.
Both initially run the same binary. For a useful version comparison, build and
preserve a separate baseline runtime, then set its directory in **Settings →
Agents → Baseline agent**. Existing saved settings are preserved; update any old
executable or deck paths manually after moving a checkout. Dialogs are resolved
inside each selected runtime's `Dialogs/` directory.

Configure the dedicated SRVPro under **Settings → SRVPro** before starting a
small regression. Arena starts and retires its own WindBot HTTP servers; a
manually started server belongs in **Remote WindBot** mode. Remote catalogs
accept the same English `bot.conf` as pasted content or a configured URL. Catalog
entries with quoted names and deck names are supported; the manual deck-picker
entry is excluded. Full display labels and deck registrations are retained;
overlong participant names use a stable hash suffix to fit WindBot's 19 UTF-16
unit wire limit without splitting surrogate pairs.

## Configure a SKYNET comparison

1. Build `../SKYNET/Skynet.sln` in Release with Visual Studio MSBuild.
2. In **Settings → Agents**, select **SKYNET** for the candidate.
3. Enter the absolute `SKYNET.exe` path and a compatible `cards.cdb`.
4. Add a profile: a unique matchup ID, a display name (up to 17 characters),
   an absolute `.ydk` path, a decision policy, and optional frozen model weights.
5. Configure the baseline with the same matchup ID. For a first integration
   comparison, use `../SKYNET/Decks/AI_ExpertOldSchool.ydk` for both participants,
   `skynet` for the candidate and `expert-oldschool` for the baseline.
6. In **Settings → SRVPro**, configure an already running, dedicated
   [arena-srvpro](https://github.com/mercury233/arena-srvpro) instance.
7. Select **Regression**, choose the matching profile and start a small run.

To inspect choices, open **Settings → Agents → Candidate agent**, enable
**Decision explanations**, save, then start a new experiment. Click the visible
**Candidate output** button under **CANDIDATE AGENT** at the top of Arena.
The panel also links back to agent settings. **Baseline output** opens the
corresponding baseline log.

Explanations report choices, alternatives, exclusions and scores for the general
policy, capped per duel. They are off by default, apply only to new duels, and
do not enable training. Expert executors do not provide these scores. Output is
a bounded recent buffer from the current Arena session: restarting Arena clears
it, and choosing an old experiment does not reload its earlier output. Existing
settings and result history are upgraded automatically; previously saved
explanation choices are preserved.
`../SKYNET/Decks/AI_SkynetSwordsoul.ydk` supplies a compact modern research route;
compare it with the same deck and an explicitly preserved previous binary before drawing
strength conclusions. It is not a full Swordsoul/Tenyi executor.

The included OldSchool executor is a simple historical baseline. For a stronger
comparison, choose **Expert · Swordsoul baseline** in the baseline profile and
provide the absolute path to `../SKYNET/Decks/AI_ExpertSwordsoul.ydk`. This
compatibility mode runs the executor's complete decision and selection lifecycle; it cannot load a learned
model. Match candidate and baseline profile IDs to compare them, and record both
deck lists when they differ. Expert decisions still require review before use
as training demonstrations.

Native launch profiles configure participants. They do not yet author card
effects, combo routes or strategy goals. Those remain separate SKYNET work.

## Dedicated local server (Windows)

Arena's explicit bootstrap uses pinned
[arena-srvpro](https://github.com/mercury233/arena-srvpro) commit
`af87d3a8c4269c105144a67221728aa25a747910` and its single locked `deepmerge`
dependency. The official source archive SHA256 is
`c6779f6d7d226bae22fa27f4eb0b860d6d5a27a575b5d430baca158918e24d37`.
Upstream is AGPL-3.0; its source and license remain in the staged runtime.
The bootstrap verifies the complete allowlisted runtime file set before patching
only listener addresses, the native host name and its parent-process guard.

Run the following from the `Arena/` directory, using Python 3.12 or newer,
Node.js 24 and the reviewed Visual Studio 2022 C++ toolchain. These examples
require explicitly supplied local inputs; they do not download dependencies or
search neighboring directories.

1. Export exact MDPro4 server/core commits and reuse dependency sources from an
   explicit previous Windows build candidate. The core must match the selected
   server's `mdpro4/build/windows-server.lock.json`. `build_arena_native.py`
   patches only the isolated copy's native listener from `INADDR_ANY` to
   `INADDR_LOOPBACK`, builds it and writes an input/build receipt.

   ```powershell
   python Tools/build_arena_native.py `
     --server-repository D:/YourSources/mdpro4-ygopro `
     --server-commit 9b65c3fc90a782742a92c3e9afa685aa0eb3feca `
     --core-repository D:/YourSources/mdpro4-ygopro-core `
     --core-commit 25eb27f6292ea407f615958fd5ff1d1db77066dc `
     --dependency-candidate D:/YourBuilds/windows-server-candidate `
     --work-dir Artifacts/arena-native `
     --msbuild 'C:/Program Files/Microsoft Visual Studio/2022/Community/MSBuild/Current/Bin/MSBuild.exe'
   ```

2. Build the owned `SKYNET_DUEL_HOST.exe` with explicit engine and data inputs.
   It accepts exactly the native API's twelve room arguments, loads only its
   staged library, rejects external expansion/script environment overrides and
   remains alive until that native room retires.

   ```powershell
   ./Tools/Build-DuelHost.ps1 `
     -Destination Artifacts/arena-host `
     -ServerLibrary Artifacts/arena-native/source/bin/release/x64/ygoserver.dll `
     -Database D:/YourGame/Data/locales/en-US/cards.cdb `
     -ScriptsArchive D:/YourGame/Data/script.zip
   ```

3. Supply the exact upstream source checkout/archive, then stage a fresh ignored
   runtime. Existing directories are never overwritten.

   ```powershell
   python Tools/arena_server.py prepare `
     --source-root Artifacts/arena-srvpro-source --runtime-dir Artifacts/arena-server `
     --native-host Artifacts/arena-host/SKYNET_DUEL_HOST.exe `
     --native-library Artifacts/arena-native/source/bin/release/x64/ygoserver.dll `
     --native-receipt Artifacts/arena-native/arena-native-receipt.json `
     --database D:/YourGame/Data/locales/en-US/cards.cdb `
     --scripts D:/YourGame/Data/script.zip
   npm --prefix Artifacts/arena-server ci --ignore-scripts --no-audit --no-fund
   python Tools/arena_server.py serve `
     --runtime-dir Artifacts/arena-server --node D:/YourNode/node.exe --minutes 60
   ```

4. In Arena's SRVPro settings, enter host `127.0.0.1`, duel port `17911`,
   management port `17922`, username `skynet-local`, and the generated password
   from that runtime's `config/admin_user.json`. Set at most two concurrent rooms
   for the default four-bot process limit. Keep credentials and runtime files
   outside commits. The dashboard and duel supervisor are separate processes.

New examples use `Arena/Artifacts/`. Previously staged workspace-root
`Artifacts/` runtimes remain valid; pass their explicit paths when resuming them.
The bootstrap's output boundary allows both ignored locations within this
workspace. It never relocates or overwrites an existing staged runtime.

The supervisor accepts authenticated Arena reboots, bounds its duration/restarts
and log size, and uses a private Windows job to retire its process tree on exit
or abrupt supervisor termination. An exclusive lease prevents duplicate owners.
Create `stop.request` inside the selected runtime to stop it; remove that exact
file explicitly before a later restart. A stale lease after forced termination
requires checking that its recorded supervisor has exited before removing it.
There is no global service, firewall change or installed-game replacement.

This bootstrap enables shuffling and disables deck legality checks for unrestricted
research comparisons. It does not expose the core RNG seed. Record these settings
with results; this is not a tournament-format benchmark. Native hosts reject
`YGOPRO_EXPANSIONS` and `YGOPRO_EXTRA_SCRIPT` overrides so staged input hashes
remain meaningful.

## Participant modes

| Mode | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| SKYNET | Direct, owned `SKYNET.exe` process for each match participant; no HTTP bridge |
| Local WindBot | Arena owns a WindBot Server process and reads its `bot.conf` |
| Remote WindBot | Connects to a manually started WindBot Server; catalog is pasted or fetched from a configured URL |

Candidate and baseline can use different modes. WindBot HTTP endpoints must be
distinct. Native SKYNET profiles accept `skynet`, `expert-oldschool` or
`expert-swordsoul`; an expert cannot use a learned model. Evaluation always
forces training and chat off.

SKYNET process limits are 2–32 (default 4), shared by executable path; when slots
share an executable, the stricter active limit applies. A global cap of 32
applies across executable paths. Room reservations
take all required seats together, avoiding partial-slot deadlocks. A 10–3600
second deadline (default 300) bounds queueing and process lifetime. Failed,
cancelled or expired launches release their owned children; unrelated bots
are never killed. Output buffers are bounded.

## Experiments and results

- **Regression:** candidate versus baseline on matching profile IDs.
- **Challenge:** one chosen profile versus a list of opponents.
- **Ranking:** continuously sample candidate deck pairs until stopped.
- **Tag smoke test:** WindBot-only stability checks; native SKYNET tag play is
  disabled until its lifecycle is validated.

Arena requires the dedicated SRVPro management and cumulative-score APIs.
The local bootstrap above provides those APIs around a separately built MDPro4
native room host. Running the standalone
`../SKYNET/Tools/Skynet/native_smoke.py` fixture alone does not provide these
management APIs.

Wins come from SRVPro scores. A successful process exit is not a win. Regression
win rate is candidate wins divided by candidate plus baseline wins; disconnects
are shown separately. Each SRVPro instance runs one experiment at a time.
Different dedicated instances can run concurrently.

Regression, Challenge and Ranking use `M#` best-of-three match rooms. Their
counts and win rates refer to matches, while Tag reports launched tag duels
and per-deck appearances. API keys such as `gamesPerMatchup` retain their
historical names. Native process deadlines cover the whole match.

The initial local run on 2026-10-20 completed 20 shuffled OldSchool mirror-deck
matches: general SKYNET won 2 and the explicit OldSchool expert won 18, with no
recorded disconnects. All clients/native rooms retired. The separately recorded
four-match integration pilot finished 2–2. These unrestricted, unseeded runs
establish a baseline, not model improvement; see the parent
[evaluation receipt](../SKYNET/Catalog/expert-baselines.json) for exact inputs and
the initial card-coverage gaps.

After the four shared card behaviors were added, two fresh 20-match runs used
the same deck and preserved baseline executable: updated SKYNET won **18–2
against previous SKYNET** and **9–11 against the OldSchool expert**, with zero
recorded disconnects in either run. Weights stayed frozen; no learning or
checkpoint promotion occurred. These small unseeded comparisons remain separate
from the initial baseline and correctness fixtures. They show progress on this
deck, not general competitive strength.

Process-fixture tests and native fixed-order duels verify plumbing and cleanup.
They do not establish strength. For strength evaluation, use varied decks,
both seats, controlled versions, sufficient completed matches, and separate
held-out comparisons before promoting a model.

The read-only results contract is documented in [API.md](API.md).

## Local data and hosting

| Environment variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SKYNET_ARENA_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | HTTP bind address |
| `SKYNET_ARENA_PORT` | `3000` | UI and API port |
| `SKYNET_ARENA_DATABASE` | `data/arena.sqlite` | SQLite path, relative to Arena or absolute |

The former `WINDBOT_ARENA_*` variables remain fallback aliases. Business settings
belong in the UI and SQLite. Database migrations preserve earlier configuration
and history; native SKYNET settings are additive.

The application has no built-in login. Keep the default loopback binding for
local use; a shared deployment needs authenticated reverse-proxy access.
Enable SSE streaming without proxy buffering and persist/backup `data/`.
The included PM2 example also binds to localhost.

## Development

```powershell
npm run dev
npm test
npm run build
python Tools/test_arena_process_owner.py
```

Tests use owned process fixtures and mocked SRVPro responses. They do not restart
a real duel server. Native SKYNET launch tests use Node as a harmless executable
fixture; actual binary/protocol completion is checked separately by the parent
project's native-duel tool.
